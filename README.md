# Kinematics Calculator
**Overview**

Kinematics Calculator is a versatile console application that covers a wide range of kinematic scenarios, providing accurate and quick solutions. Whether you are calculating displacement over a time interval or determining the instantaneous velocity of an object, this tool streamlines the process, allowing users to focus on the conceptual understanding of kinematics rather than the computational intricacies.

**Features**
- **Displacement, Time Interval, and Average Velocity:** Calculates the displacement of an object based on its average velocity and the time interval it travels.
- **Instantaneous Velocity:** Computes the exact velocity of an object at a specific moment in time.
- **Average and Instantaneous Acceleration:** Provides tools to determine both average acceleration over a period and instantaneous acceleration at a specific point in time.
- **Constant Acceleration:** Solves for final velocity, displacement, or time in scenarios where acceleration is constant. It simplifies calculations for uniformly accelerated motion scenarios.
- **Free Fall:** Analyzes the motion of objects under the influence of gravity. Calculates how gravitational acceleration affects an object's motion during free fall.
- **Finding Velocity and Displacement from Acceleration:** Determines an object's velocity and displacement based on its acceleration. Provides insights into how acceleration impacts an object's motion over time.
- **Finding Velocity and Displacement from Acceleration:** This feature aids in determining an object's velocity and displacement based on its acceleration.
